# 1.0.4

## Fixed

* Fixed issue with container name resolution that caused incorrect params to be passed to GET_BY_ID operations
* Fixed an issue where HTTPErrors where incorrectly raised, causing confusing exceptions

# 1.0.3

## Changed

* Added dry_mode switch to FMC object. When using dry_mode PUT, POST and DELETE
* Operations are not executed and only logged to FireREST logger

## Fixed

* Added missing `Override` reference to host object

# 1.0.2

## New

# 1.0.1

## Fixed

* Fixed an issue where simplejson installation cause FireREST to be unusable
  due to requests library using simplejson instead of built-in json library
  causing simplejson exception to be thrown instead of json.DecodeError exception

# 1.0.0

1.0.0 is a major overhaul of the existing FireREST codebase. I decided to
refactor the whole project to provide a more structured way to interact with
FMC. Before 1.0.0 all calls to FMC were provided by a `Client` object which was
replaced by `FMC` that provides a hierarchical access to all resources on FMC.

## Changed

* Replaced `Client` object with `FMC`
* Provide structured access to api objects. e.g. `fmc.policy.accesspolicy.get`
* Provide more granular error handling using custom exceptions

  * accesspolicy defaultaction
  * device metrics
  * device commands

## Fixed

* Issue with incorrect default id values
