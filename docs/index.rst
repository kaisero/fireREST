FireREST Documentation
======================

FireREST is a python library for Cisco Firepower Management Center. The goal of
FireREST is to provide a simple interface to interact with FMCs REST API without
much overhead.

**Features**

* Authentication and automatic session refresh / re-authentication
* Rate-limit handling with automatic retry operations
* Automatic squashing of paginated api payloads
* Sanitization of api payloads for create and update operations
* Detailed logging of api calls

**Supported operations**

Since FireREST does not try to provide a python object model nearly all api
calls up to version 6.7.0
